Subject: [PATCH] mtd: spi: spi-nor-core: Check the 4byte opcode supporting

Root cause:
- Currently UBoot version (19.04) is out of date from Kernel for SPINOR
driver, UBoot driver always uses EN4B commands to enter 4B-address mode
without checking the SPINOR supports 4bytes address op code. While
Kernel driver will skip enter 4B-address mode if the SPINOR already
supported 4bytes address op code.
- Problem occurs when user presses SRST reset button, the SPINOR is
still in 4B-address mode while the ROM AST2600 code reads SPINOR with
3B-address mode so it cannot read data to boot.

Solution:
- Apply solution from Kernel to UBoot: NOT enter 4B-address mode for
the SPINOR which already supported 4bytes address op code.
